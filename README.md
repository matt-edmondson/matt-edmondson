# Hi, I'm Matt Edmondson! üëã

## About Me

I'm a veteran **game developer**, **software engineer**, and **producer** based in Melbourne, Australia. Over the past decade-plus I've worn many hats at game studios ‚Äì from hands-on coding to leadership. I spent over 10 years at **Electronic Arts (EA)** Firemonkeys studio, initially as a software engineer and later transitioning into a producer role. More recently, I've taken on the challenge of **Studio Production Lead** at an indie studio called *The Three Thousands*, guiding a team to bring new game projects to life.

Throughout my career I've embraced a range of roles from **engineering** to **production**, while also contributing to **game design**, **3D art**, **sound design**, and **music** along the way. This cross-disciplinary experience means I can dive into code, collaborate on art and audio, and oversee project strategy all at once. I love building things ‚Äì be it a game, a custom engine, or even a DIY synthesizer ‚Äì and each new project is a chance to blend creativity with technology.

## Current Projects ‚Äì ktsu.dev üöÄ

These days, outside of my work at *The Three Thousands*, a lot of my passion is focused on **[ktsu.dev](https://ktsu.dev)** ‚Äì a collection of open-source .NET libraries and tools I started building in 2023. I began the **ktsu.dev** project because I believe strongly in writing clear, maintainable code that reduces cognitive load and minimizes errors. In a nutshell, ktsu.dev is all about making .NET development more **expressive**, **reliable**, and **developer-friendly**. It's a growing toolbox (available as NuGet packages) aimed at helping developers build software ‚Äì whether it's games, applications, or tools ‚Äì with fewer bugs and more confidence.

### What is ktsu.dev?

It's *my take on improving the developer experience in .NET*. The libraries in this collection are designed to encourage good software design and eliminate common pitfalls. For example, one of my libraries, **StrongPaths**, turns file paths into strongly-typed semantic objects, so mistakes like mixing up directories and filenames are caught at compile time instead of causing crashes or undefined behaviors in production. Overall, ktsu.dev reflects lessons learned from years in industry ‚Äì it's about coding smarter, with an emphasis on **semantics**, **maintainability**, and **simplicity**.

## Development Philosophy

I care deeply about organizational culture, psychological safety, inclusive design, and the overall developer experience. I believe that these aspects are grown and nurtured through intentional decisions rooted in a thoughtfully considered personal philosophy. For me, great outcomes begin with clarity of purpose and deliberate choices at every step.

Here are a few core principles that guide my work and the projects I build:

- **Semantic Clarity & Type Safety:** I believe code should *communicate intent*. Wherever possible I use strong semantic typing to catch errors early. (Why rely on primitive types that need additional documentation when a well-named semantic type clearly conveys intent?) For instance, libraries like **StrongPaths** and **SemanticQuantity** embed context into the types, preventing invalid uses and catching mistakes at compile time. This approach means fewer bugs and a safer codebase.

- **Simplified Workflows:** Development should be enjoyable, not tedious. I aim to reduce boilerplate and cognitive overhead for developers. Tools in ktsu.dev (such as **AppDataStorage** for easy config file management or **IntervalAction** for timing tasks) streamline common tasks. By automating repetitive patterns, these utilities let you focus on the fun (and important) parts of coding rather than reinventing the wheel each time.

- **Maintainability & Clean Design:** In my view, good software design is **human-friendly**. I strive to write code that's easy to read, test, and extend. Each of my libraries aims to be built around clear, consistent patterns with thorough documentation and comprehensive test coverage. Future maintainers (including future me!) should be able to understand how everything works at a glance. Keeping things elegant and well-documented is a point of pride for me (yes, I *do* enjoy writing docs).

- **Modern .NET Practices:** I'm a .NET enthusiast who loves using the latest and greatest the platform has to offer. From async/await and LINQ, to newer features like nullable reference types and even experimental generic math, I enjoy leveraging modern .NET capabilities to make code more robust. I also make sure my projects stay up-to-date with the newest .NET releases and tools. (CI/CD, NuGet packages, and analyzers are all part of the workflow.) Embracing current best practices means developers can seamlessly integrate my libraries and use them with confidence in production.

## Beyond Code

While game and software development is my main focus, I'm also passionate about the creative arts. I dabble in **music production** and **sound design**, and I've been known to build analog synthesizer modules and guitar pedals in my spare time. On the visual side, I have enjoyed **3D modeling**, **digital art**, and **photography** ‚Äî skills I‚Äôve put to use in game jams and personal projects. These cross-disciplinary hobbies aren't just enjoyable; they provide fresh perspectives that frequently inspire my approach to game development and software design.

I also love **writing**. Whether it's composing user stories, crafting design documents, writing technical articles, or documenting my code, I value clear communication. In fact, I consider clear documentation and tutorials integral to good software design and strive to ensure each of my projects includes developer-friendly docs.

## Let's Connect ü§ù

I‚Äôm always excited to connect with others who share interests in tech, games, or creative projects. I firmly believe in the value of **mentoring and knowledge-sharing** ‚Äì if you're an aspiring developer or creator, I'm happy to help where I can. Likewise, I'm always open to learning from others and collaborating on cool ideas.
